This is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a quiz application.


The HTML code includes a container for the quiz, a header, a footer, and several elements for displaying questions, answer options, and results.


The CSS code styles the container and its elements, such as font size, margin, padding, and background color.


The JavaScript code includes an array of questions and answers, a variable for the current question, and a variable for the score.


The code also includes a function to display the questions and answer options, a function to check the selected answer, and an event listener for the "Next" button.


When a user clicks on an answer, the code checks if it is the correct answer and disables all other answer options. If all questions have been answered, the code displays the final score and a "Retry" button if the score is less than 70%.


When the "Retry" button is clicked, the code resets the current question and score and displays the questions again.
